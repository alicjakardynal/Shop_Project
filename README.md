# Shop_Project

My work is animated website modeled on the online store with snowboarding equipment.
It has a basket with price calculation and the ability to filter products by riding style. I love snowboarding that is why i had these idea of create it and how can i help to make these shopping more satisfying.

I am working with React Javascript CSS HTML.

I focused on the animated intro that starts the page. The intention was to facilitate the shopping of potential customers and to quickly and visually familiarize with the type of offered equipment . Not everyone has knowledge of specific items and this solution would easily help them in choosing the right things. Of course, it is possible to bypass this intro by clicking the button. I think the whole concept also affects the attractiveness and functionality of the website.
